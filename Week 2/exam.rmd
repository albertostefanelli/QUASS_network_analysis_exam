<!-- Questions that help in structuring your paper:
  
TASK: Analyze your RECENS classroom (the one you do all the individual practices on during the class) with the studied methods and compare the results from static and dynamic models.


1.a. What are the main characteristics of the friendship network at the two observations? Are they similar/different?
1.b. What are the relations between gender, drinking, and friendship in wave 1? How do these change by wave 2?
2. Which micro patterns are important in explaining the structure of the two friendship networks (separately)?
3. Which micro mechanisms shape the evolution of the friendship network in your classroom?
4. State one hypothesis about other micro mechanisms which you could test with the learnt methods. -->
